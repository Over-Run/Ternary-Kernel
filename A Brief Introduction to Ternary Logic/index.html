<h1>A Brief Introduction to Ternary Logic</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">Jorge Pedraza Arpasi *</h2>

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Based on the work of Ivan Guzmán de Rojas <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> and some basic notions of
binary logic and algebra of Boole, we will introduce and show some elementary
properties of ternary logic.<br>
These properties can be resumed as follows: <b>a)</b> Ternary logic is a
generalization of binary login, <b>b)</b> it has not a structure to be a
Boolean algebra, <b>c)</b> it is based on more than three basic operations, and
<b>d)</b> its tautologies and contradictions are more complicated for find out.
The generalization is in the sense that if one proposition <i>p</i> is
true(false) under the rules of binary logic then it is true(false) under the
ternary logic. The lack of Boolean structure, in ternary logic, is compensated
by powerful tools for inferential analysis <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>In this note, for the binary case, we will use the values {0,1} which means
true=1 and false=0. Whereas that for ternary case we will use the values
{0,1,2} which means true=1, false=2, and "perhaps true perhaps false"=0. This
notation is the most adequate for a later algebraic analysis. By <i>x</i> we
will mean a simple statement or proposition whereas by <i>p</i> or <i>f</i> we
will mean a composed proposition which depends other simple propositions, hence
we also refer they as functions.</p>
